    Hey, I'm Markus and this is my blog [currently under construction].
    I'm planning to post about my own developments and successes in anything tech
    related like learning new programming languages and DIY projects mainly to
    kind of develop a habit and motivate myself to learn new things.

    And if someone want's to join me on my journey that's fine, but actually i really don't expect anybody
    to read this.

    The longer I think about it, I can not promise that one day this might end in a food blog.

    Neverless, some information about me:

    *   I'm 20 years old
    *   I live near Passau, a city located in lower bavaria
    *   I'm studying 'Mobile and Embedded Systems' at the university of Passau
    *   I like black tea

    That's everthing I wanted to say for now, but this section will develop further in the near future for quite sure.
    Have fun!
