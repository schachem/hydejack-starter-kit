I’m planning to post about my own developments and successes in anything tech related like learning new programming languages and DIY projects mainly to kind of develop a habit and motivate myself to learn new things.

And if someone want’s to join me on my journey that’s fine, but actually i really don’t expect anybody to read this.

The longer I think about it, I can not promise that one day this might end in a food blog.

Neverless, some information about me:

* I’m 20 years old
* live near Passau, a city located in lower bavaria
* I like black tea

That’s everthing I wanted to say for now, but this section will develop further in the near future for quite sure. Have fun!
